    "\n",
    "- **Total transportation cost** decreased by **47.13%** under the new plan.\n",
    "- **Maximum delivery time** decreased by **31.16%** under the new plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "Both the Logistics plan (minimizing total cost) and the Publicity plan (minimizing maximum delivery time) yield the same solution:\n",
    "- **Selected hubs**: Taipei and Linkou North\n",
    "- **Total transportation cost**: 264.15\n",
    "- **Average delivery time**: 2.17 minutes\n",
    "- **Maximum delivery time**: 9.52 minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to the current single-hub setup (only Taipei as the hub), the two-hub solution offers significant improvements:\n",
    "- Total cost reduction by 47.13%.\n",
    "- Maximum delivery time reduction by 31.16%.\n",
    "- Average delivery time reduction from 4.10 minutes to 2.17 minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Since both optimization objectives lead to the same hub selection and performance metrics, there is no conflict between the two plans.  \n",
    "The company can simultaneously achieve both goals: **minimizing overall transportation cost** and **shortening the longest delivery time**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, implementing the new two-hub strategy with Taipei and Linkou North is strongly recommended, as it clearly improves both operational efficiency and service level compared to the current setup."
