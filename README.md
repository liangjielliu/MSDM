# MSDM Coursework & Projects

This repository contains my coursework, assignments, and project codes from the **MSc in Data-Driven Modeling (MSDM)** program at **The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)**.  

The contents are quite mixed, including **Jupyter notebooks, reports, datasets, experiment results, and project files** from different courses. Some are formal assignments or projects, while others are experiments and notes made during the learning process.  

Main contents include:
- Course assignments (ipynb, pdf, docx)
- Project codes and reports (algorithm, machine learning, statistical modeling, data analysis, etc.)
- Datasets (csv, xlsx, json, npy)
- Visualizations and result plots (png, jpg, pdf)
- Other study materials and experimental files  

Overall, this repository serves as a record of my learning and research journey during the MSDM masterâ€™s program.
